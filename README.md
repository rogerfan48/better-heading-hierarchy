## Installation

- simply install this plugin via Obsidian community plugins panel.
- Additionally, highly recommend to use default theme with `additional author-styled CSS` enabled in the setting. By doing so, you can get the best experience â€” just like I do.
    - if enabling `additional author-styled CSS`, please install [Swei Gothic CJK TC](https://github.com/max32002/swei-gothic/releases) (install `CJK TC` series) as the main fonts and install [JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) (install `JetBrainsMonoNerdFontMono` series) to have wonderful experience.
    - if you want to use the exactly font I'm using in the demo image, which is a paid font, please install [jf-jinxuan](https://justfont.com/jinxuan/).
